## Inspiration
In our difficult times, many **_problems can be solved collectively_**, regardless of their scale.
Whether it's global warming, the extinction of any animal species, or a virus epidemic.
All these problems are beginning to have a strong impact on our lifestyle, especially now.
> In order to change the current state of affairs, we decided to make an application that will make the process of raising funds for charity **_quick, convenient and cute_**.
## What our app does?
The application allows people to donate money to charity in a **_fun, competitve and easy_** format.
It perfectly fits into the online network or city streets infrastructure, where you can find our **QR-Codes** to scan.

## How we built it
We built it using technologies such as:
| Frontend | Backend |
| ------ | ------ |
| JavaScript | koa |
| WebComponents | MongoDB |
| HTML | - |
| CSS | - |

## Challenges we ran into
- **New technologies** in our stack
    - WebComponents
    - Payment APIs
- Serverside architecture since we are all frontend devs :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We dont need to build our app, such as **react** apps for example. Because it uses native **WebComponents** technology on a client side.
- We have a real **noSQL** based backend with custom **API**.
- We have a **Facebook** authorization as an option. That way users can share with their friends.

## What we learned
- [WebComponents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) is a fast and strong method of creating an app
- Facebook API
- Google pay and Apple pay APIs

## What's next for Project Lambda
Scale it up, make it perfect, attract investments.
